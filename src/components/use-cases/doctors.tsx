               As a doctor, you can use our platform to manage patients with less administrative
               work. Every patient has a comprehensive profile with medical history, lab results,
               and prescriptions. This reduces repeated questions and shortens consultation times.

            <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-7 mb-6">
               You can consult from anywhere using either video, audio, or chat while maintaining
               full visibility of patient information. You can order lab tests and prescriptions
               directly through the system, and your patients get to receive their results without
               delay, and share updates with you as a doctor instantly.

               Our platformâ€™s AI-driven features assist with identifying patterns, improving
               diagnostic accuracy, and reducing errors. We designed our platform to support
               efficiency without losing the human side of care.
